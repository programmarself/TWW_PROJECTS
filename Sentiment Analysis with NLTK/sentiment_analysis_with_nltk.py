This project uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to perform sentiment analysis on text data.
"""

# Install NLTK
!pip install nltk

# Import Libraries
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
nltk.download('punkt')

# Initialize the sentiment analyzer
sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Sample text
text = "I love using Google Colab for python projects. It is fantastic!"

# Perform sentiment analysis
scores = sid.polarity_scores(text)
print(scores)

"""**1):  'neg' (Negative):** The proportion of the text that is considered negative. In this case, 0.0 means there is no negative sentiment detected in the text.

**2): 'neu' (Neutral):** The proportion of the text that is considered neutral. Here, 0.527 indicates that 52.7% of the text is neutral, meaning it's neither positive nor negative.

**3): 'pos' (Positive):** The proportion of the text that is considered positive. A value of 0.473 means that 47.3% of the text is positive.

**4): 'compound':** The compound score is a normalized score that combines all the individual sentiment scores into a single value.
It ranges from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive). In this case, 0.8439 indicates a strongly positive sentiment.

**Overall Sentiment:**\
 The compound score of 0.8439 suggests that the overall sentiment of the text is positive.\
**Distribution of Sentiments:**\
0% of the text is negative.\
49.7% is neutral.\
50.3% is positive.
